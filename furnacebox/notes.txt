DON'T STORE FURNACE, DRAW STRAIGHT FROM FILE (is that any different, memory-wise?)

____________________________
CUT OUT OVERLAY OF FURNACE

RANDOMIZE FIRE PIXELS UNDER FURNACE IN A SMALL RECTANGLE (or maybe even the exact shape of the fire, which can be calculated the same way you calculated fireshape)

EITHER FADE PIXELS IN AND OUT, OR REGENERATE PATTERNS OF RED/ORANGE/YELLOW. MAYBE EVEN BOTH!
